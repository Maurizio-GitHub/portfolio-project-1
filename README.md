# NFTs For Dummies

NFTs For Dummies is a simple website built to introduce the NFT topic to the large audience: anyone who has never been familiar with it so far.

The site mainly targets people who usually do their first searches to get their head around this relatively new phenomenon. Yet, the presented information, wisely cherry-picked and kept concise, is still dense of concepts and, hence, also aim to draw the attention of crypto-friendly users and content creators who would like to know more about the relationship between NFTs and Digital Art.
