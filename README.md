# NFTs For Dummies

NFTs For Dummies is a simple website built to introduce the NFT topic to the large audience: anyone who has never been familiar with it so far.

The site mainly targets people who usually do their first searches to get their head around this relatively new phenomenon. Yet, the presented information, wisely cherry-picked and kept concise, is still dense of concepts and, hence, also aim to draw the attention of crypto-friendly users and content creators who would like to know more about the relationship between NFTs and Digital Art.

## Features

<br>

- Navigation menu

    - Featured on every page, a responsive navigation menu includes links to the website Home page, Milestones, Digital Art and Newsletter page. It is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation: users can surf from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the 'back' button. Each page-link is accompanied by an elegant icon conceptually representing the section it refers to:

<br>

- Footer

    - The footer section encourages the user to keep in touch via social media: it contains a written invitation as a valuable call to action and includes links to the relevant social media pages. Each link opens to a new tab to allow for an easier navigation:

    - A vertical, responsive timeline, showcasing the most important milestones achieved by the NFT world, was added to show the user how compelling this continuous evolution has been so far:

<br>

- Digital Art page

    - This section was added to introduce newbies and content creators to the real revolution taking place in the world of digital art thanks to NFTs. Complex, yet easily explained, concepts, accompanied by a brief historical excursus, are followed by curiosities and upheavals in the world of art. In addition, the much talked about artwork of Beeple is shown, with a direct, external link to the mind-boggling auction ended on March 11, 2021:

## Testing

<br>

- The website was successfully tested on different browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari.
- The website is responsive and looks good on different devices. Its functioning was successfully tested on all standard screen sizes by using Chrome DevTools.
- I confirmed that any single navigation element and piece of text is readable, easy to understand and fully accessible.
- I confirmed that the subscription form properly works. It requires entries on every field, will only accept an email in the relevant field and the 'Join' button does exactly what it was designed to do.

<br>

## Bugs

<br>

- Fixed bugs

    - The home page, at the very beginning, had not been built with a mobile-first approach. This resulted in a poor mobile experience, net of the necessary media queries added. Therefore, by changing approach, code became easier to (re)write and the page much better to look at.

<br>

- Unfixed bugs

    - No unfixed bugs to report.

<br>

## Validator Testing

<br>

- HTML

    - No errors found via the official W3C validator.

<br>

- CSS

    - No errors found via the official Jigsaw validator.

<br>

- Accessibility

    - I confirmed that both colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and tested accessibility via Lighthouse, within Chrome DevTools.

<br>

## Deployment

<br>

- The website was deployed to GitHub Pages through the following steps:

    - Navigation to the 'Setting' tab within the project repository;
    - Selection of 'main' branch from the 'Branch' section dropdown menu;
    - Confirmation by clicking on 'Save' to get the link to the website.
