                <p class="art-paragraphs">
                    Digital Art is a way of exploring creativity through technology. Versatility offered by computers
                    for the creation of images have attracted many artists since the '70s. Those first experiments,
                    thanks to the development of computerized graphics, multiplied so much that, in the following
                    decade, a new expressive current in the visual arts field emerged: the computer art.
                </p>
                <p class="art-paragraphs">
                    However, it is only thanks to the blockchain that things have radically changed. Before the advent
                    of the blockchain technology any content on the web was easily reproducible. A digital art work
                    could not be guaranteed as authentic as a traditional art work. The blockchain technology, by
                    writing on a public digital ledger and, hence, performing notary-like functions, stores information
                    that cannot be modified in relation to a digital product. This communicates the non-reproducibility
                    of the product itself.
                </p>
                <p class="art-paragraphs">
                    The important innovation, here, is the right of ownership on the art work: whoever buys a work
                    linked to an NFT does not acquire the work itself, but the possibility to demonstrate a right on
                    that work. Thanks to the hashing technology, an NFT keeps a trace of all the changes in ownership up
                    to its creator, hence, identifying its current possessor. Consequently, the owner of the hash will
                    be able to demonstrate their rights without needing intermediaries and, above all, without time
                    limits.
                </p>
                <p class="art-paragraphs">
                    Crypto-art covers many genres. The most popular relates to images being as much original as
                    possible, but even a tweet can find a market if it carries a certain symbolic value. What matters is
                    that they depict something iconic.
                </p>
                <p class="art-paragraphs">
                    A practical example? The famous 'Bored Ape Yacht Club'. Bored Apes are NFT avatars: 10,000 monkeys,
                    randomly generated via an algorithm, which have been sold for considerable sums. This phenomenon
                    exploded in less than a year, also involving quite a few number of celebrities, who bought an image
                    depicting a Bored Ape for millions of dollars to use it on their social media profiles.

                    NFTs were regularly created and used as early as 2017, but not for artistic reasons. The turning
                    point came in 2021, when <a href="https://www.beeple-crap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                        aria-label="Visit Beeple's website (it opens in a new tab)"> Beeple</a>'s work "EVERYDAYS: THE
                    FIRST 5000 DAYS" was auctioned by Christie's for a countervalue in Ether of 69 million dollars! The
                    fact that a digital art work reached the third highest price ever paid for a work by a living artist
                    reached the front pages of all newspapers, completely upsetting the art world.
                </p>
                <p class="art-paragraphs">
                    Of course, what scandalized the art world is that this transaction did not need art-insiders at all:
                    it bypassed whoever was considered a gatekeeper, whether critical curators, museum directors or
                    gallery owners. It disintermediated the entire world of art, by making supply and demand the only
                    rules by which this work was exchanged.
